Arduino Nano ISP Bootloader Programmer
This project creates a complete standalone ISP programmer for Arduino Nano devices using another Arduino Nano as the programmer. It's designed to program the Optiboot bootloader onto ATmega328P microcontrollers without requiring external hardware or files.
How It Works
Core Functionality:

Contains a complete 512-byte Optiboot bootloader embedded in the code
Acts as an ArduinoISP-compatible programmer that starts automatically when powered
Programs target Arduino Nano boards via SPI communication

Programming Process:

Connection: Programmer Nano connects to target Nano via SPI pins (D10-D13) plus power and ground
Initiation: Press start button (D2) or send "start" via serial monitor
ISP Sequence:

Enters ISP programming mode
Verifies target chip (ATmega328P)
Sets proper fuse bits for bootloader operation
Erases target chip
Programs embedded Optiboot bootloader
Verifies successful programming
Sets lock bits



Status Indicators:

Programming LED (D7): Lit during active programming
Error LED (D8): Solid when programming fails
Heartbeat LED (D9): Slow blinking when last programming succeeded
Done LED (D3): Lit when programming completes successfully

Key Features:

No external bootloader files needed - everything is self-contained
Serial monitor feedback at 115200 baud shows detailed progress
Compatible with standard ArduinoISP wiring
Automatic restart capability for programming multiple devices
Comprehensive verification ensures reliable bootloader installation

Once programmed, target devices can be uploaded to via Arduino IDE at 115200 baud with 32KB of available flash memory.
